\title{Evaluate rule to obtain positive / negative cells}
\usage{
evaluate_rule(obj, feature, operator, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A cellpypes object, see section \strong{cellpypes Objects} below.}

\item{feature}{Character scalar naming the gene you'd like to threshold.}

\item{operator}{One of \code{c(">","<")}. Use ">" for positive (CD3E+) and
"<" for negative markers (MS4A1-).}

\item{threshold}{Numeric scalar with the expression threshold separating positive
from negative cells.}

\item{class}{A character scalar with the class.}
}
\value{
logical vector stating for each cell whether the rule is true.
}
\description{
The rule is defined by feature, operator and threshold.
}
\section{cellpypes Objects}{

A cellpypes object is a \link[base]{list} with four slots:
\itemize{
\item{\code{raw }}{(sparse) matrix with genes in rows, cells in columns}
\item{\code{totalUMI }}{the colSums of obj$raw}
\item{\code{embed }}{two-dimensional embedding of the cells, provided as data.frame
or tibble with two columns and one row per cell.}
\item{\code{neighbors }}{index matrix with one row per cell and k columns, where
k is the number of nearest neighbors (we recommend 15<k<100, e.g. k=50).
Here are two ways to get the neighbors index matrix:
\itemize{
\item Use \code{find_knn(featureMatrix)$idx}, where featureMatrix could be
principal components, latent variables or normalized genes (features in
rows, cells in columns).
\item use \code{as(seurat@graphs[["RNA_nn"]], "dgCMatrix")> .1} to extract
the kNN
graph computed on RNA. The \code{> .1} ensures this also works with RNA_snn,
wknn/wsnn or any other
available graph â€“ check with \code{names(seurat@graphs)}.
