## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* removed the VignetteBuilder field as there are no vignettes in this package
* updated links to CRAN packages, now using the canonical URL
* updated link to Bioconductor package, now starting with 'https'


## Test environments
* local R installation (ubuntu), R 4.1.3
* win-builder (devel)
* win-builder (release)
* win-builder (oldrelease)
* macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra, R-release, CRAN's setup (rhub::check())


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes

   
* Note1: New submission.


## CRAN incoming feasibility

* Note: Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    cellpypes  (that's the name of this package, no spelling error)
    pseudobulks (that's jargon/terminology, no spelling error)
