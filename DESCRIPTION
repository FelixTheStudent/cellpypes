Description: Annotate single-cell RNA sequencing data manually based on
    marker gene thresholds.
    Find cell type rules (gene+threshold) through exploration,
    use the popular piping operator %>% to reconstruct complex
    cell type hierarchies.
    cellpypes models technical noise to find positive and negative cells for
    a given expression threshold and returns cell type labels or pseudobulks.
